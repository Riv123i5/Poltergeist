# Changes:
- 0.1.2
	- Added the ability to switch between the modded and vanilla spectate modes using the "Item Secondary Use" key (default Q).
		- Also added a "DefaultToVanilla" config option to determine what spectate mode you start in on death.
	- Allow teleporting to player corpses and masked players.
	- Removed the "RunBarebones" option.
- 0.1.1
	- Added two config options to make things more customizeable.
		- RunBarebones: Tells the mod to not do most of the main functionality (good for people who like vanilla spectating, but want to play with others with the mod).
		- GhostLightIntensity: Determines the intensity of the global light for ghosts.
- 0.1.0
	- First release with basic functionality.
